## v0.4.1 — Security hardening

- Runs the general protected-route rate limiter before authentication, so failed authentication attempts are limited.
- Requires every configured gateway credential to be a distinct, exactly 64-character hexadecimal key generated from 32 random bytes.
- Refuses to start write-enabled deployments without an explicit `ALLOWED_ENTITIES` allow-list.
- Adds security regression tests for these controls.
